## ADR-0002 — Booking pages use a scoped live-brand theme

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-19

**Context.** The booking routes had to match the current production UI at
vanduomarse.lt, while the homepage redesign uses its own palette and type.

**Decision.** A `.theme-marse` class in `app/globals.css` remaps the semantic
tokens (`--ink`, `--dust`, `--rust`, `--foam`, …) and the display face
(`--display-face`, `--display-stretch`, `--display-case`). `font-display` is a
custom `@utility`, not an `@theme` font key, because Tailwind inlines theme values
and collapses `var()` fallbacks, which made the face impossible to swap per scope.

**Consequences.** Any component rendered inside `theme-marse` picks up the live
brand with no class changes. Termina itself is licensed; Archivo (width axis) is
the stand-in until the client supplies the webfont.

## ADR-0001 — Documentation lives in an in-repo Obsidian vault

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-19

**Context.** Project knowledge (why a pattern exists, what not to touch, how to add
a feature) was scattered across chat history, READMEs, and people's heads. AI agents
re-derived it every session and got it wrong.

**Decision.** All project documentation lives in `obsidian/`, a linked Obsidian vault
committed to the repo. Root `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `.cursorrules` are thin shims
pointing into it. Claude Code hooks inject the pointer at session start, remind on
every prompt, and block once at Stop when code changed without a doc update.

**Consequences.** Documentation is versioned with the code and reviewed in the same
PR. Every code change carries a doc obligation. Agents get consistent context without
re-reading the whole codebase.
